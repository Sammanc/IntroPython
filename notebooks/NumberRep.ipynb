    "The Roman numeral system is probably somewhat familiar to you. It is actually partially unary: 1, 2 and 3 are *I*, *II*, and *III*. Five is *V*, while four is \"5 - 1,\" designated by putting the *I* before the *V*: *IV*. Then 6, 7 and 8 go back to unary: *VI*, *VII*, *VIII*. Ten is *X*, while nine is \"10 - 1\": *IX*.\n",

    "Things get much better when we line numbers up in positions according to some *base* factor, and have the idea of *zero* available for when some place is missing. So, in base ten, we have, on the far right, the *units* place, followed by the *tens* place, the *hundreds* place, the *thousands* place, and so on. With this system, we can use the same digits over and over again, to represent a number however big we want. So:"
