    "The distinctions between *operators* and *functions* in programming languages is somewhat arbitrary. What are regarded as *operators* are typically the mathemical symbols that come in between their *operands*, while in a function call, the name of the function comes first, followed by its *arguments*, which are equivalent to the *operands* of an *operator*. What the hey does all of this verbiage mean? Well, essentially, `add(3, 4)` is an alernative way of saying `3 + 4`"
